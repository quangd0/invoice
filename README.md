# invoice
This is the test project for a client
Please be patient as the test server is very slow.


You need to go to http://timesheet.lhslive.com/auth/login. Any other url will result in error.
The application will allow a user: test, pass: test to login. Any other name will result in a login page.
And after the user has login, the app will redirect the user the the page /invoice. 
This page in itself has lots of javascripting to make all the html, bootstraps come to live. 

The purpose of the excercise was to code simple ZendFramework, php, javascript, jquery and bootstrap for the description given.

The application has all the ZendFramework infrastructure setup and mysql. It does not check for errors and user input errors because in my opinion it is beyond the scope of the excercise. 

I had spent 8 hours working on the interview test description.

The user can create the PDF file from the page he is entering the data. Again, there is no test is done to ensure the PDF is correct, but the establishment of connecting the page to the PDF is working.
